# Vim Extensions on PE Hosts

CS1010 provides a minimal set of vim extensions (i.e., plugins and color schemes) officially.  At the beginning of the semester, students can install the same set of extensions following the [vim setup](vim-setup.md) procedure.
The same set of official extensions will be made available during the practical exams.

Students are free to install any additional color schemes or plugins if they wish.  These additional extensions, however, are not allowed and will not be available during the practical exams.

The following are the officially supported vim extensions in CS1010.

## Color Schemes

We installed three color schemes `~cs1010/.vim/colors`.  You may copy them over to your own home directory, by running

```
mkdir -p ~/.vim
cp -r ~cs1010/.vim/colors ~/.vim
```

The three color schemes are:

- [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
- [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai)
- [onedark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)

You can change your vim color scheme using the `:color` command.  For instance,

```
:color gruvbox
```

You can add the line `color gruvbox` (without `:`) to your `~/.vimrc` so that the color scheme is loaded at the start of every vim session.

Some color schemes display differently depending on whether the background is set to `dark` or `light`

Some examples, with `set background=dark` in `~/.vimrc`:

The Vim default color scheme:

The molokai (CS1010's default) color scheme:

The gruvbox color scheme

## Plugins

`vim` plugins are installed under `~/.vim/pack/plugins/start`.

CS1010 supports only one plugin: [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic), which automatically checks for syntax and style errors every time a file is saved (when you run `:w`).

The syntastic configuration in the CS1010 `~/.vimrc` has been made to work with the exercise/assignment setups. As such, it might not work as intended if you edit a C file outside the CS1010 setup.
