### Advice on PE

---
### Think and plan before you code

- Time spent thinking &lt; debugging (usually).

- Use the reasoning tools to help you: assertions, invariants, terminating loops, etc.

- Trial-and-error might works for certain inputs (but may not be correct).

---
### Code incrementally

- Make sure your code works for simple cases before extending it to complex cases.

- Make sure your initial steps is correct, before continuing to the next steps.

---
### Decompose into smaller problem

- Break down the problem into manageable chunks, then code for each one.

- Smaller, independent, functions are easier to reason about, to test, and to debug.

- If you need to cut-and-paste, something is amiss.

---
### Read error messages, test, and debug

Recap the techniques your tutors have taught you during labs.

---
### Thinking recursively for recursive problems

If you try to solve it iteratively and convert your solution to a recursive one, your solution is likely too complicated.

---
### Avoid loosing "easy" marks

- Indent your code

- Get rid of warnings
