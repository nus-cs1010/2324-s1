Copy the following files from the home directory of CS1010 again:

- `.clang-tidy`
- `compile_flags.txt`

We added new flags to help detect with memory errors.

---
### Variable 

- A place in memory that holds one or more values

- Every variable has a name, a type, a value, and an address

- We can access a variable through its name or its memory address

---
### Accessing a Variable Through Its Name

```C
a = b;
```

Copy the value stored in memory location named `b` 

into the memory location named `a`.

---
### Address-of operator `&`

if `x` is the name of a variable, `&x` is its memory address.

---
```C
long c;
cs1010_println_long(c);
cs1010_println_pointer(&c);
```

---
### Array Decay

```C
long a[30];
long *addr = a;
```

`a` is just `&a[0]`.

---
### Pointer 

A variable that stores a memory address (mostly of other variables)

```C
long *addr;
addr = &c;
```

---
### Accessing the Address of a Variable 

```C
a = &b;
```

Copy the _address_ of the memory location named `b` 

into the memory location named `a`.

---
### Dereference operator `*`

if `x` is a pointer (a variable storing a memory address), `*x` is the content of that memory address.

---
### Changing variable via its address 

.fit[![pointer](../notes/figures/lec07-pointers/lec07-pointers-pdf-4.png)]

---
### Accessing a Variable Through Its Address

```C
a = *b;
```

Copy the value stored in the memory location _of which the address is stored in memory location_ named `b` 

into the memory location named `a`.

---
### Accessing a Variable Through Its Address

```C
*a = b;
```

Copy the value stored in the memory location named `b`

into the memory location _of which the address is stored in memory location_ named `a` 


---
### Common Bug

```C
long *addr;
*addr = 15;
```

---
### During execution, your code must access only

1. Memory on the allocated stack frames


---
### Pointer Types

- if `x` as the type `T`, `&x` has the type `T*` (pointer to `T` / address of `T`)

- if `x` as the type `T*`, `*x` has the type `T`

---
### Pointers must be of the same type

```C
double p = 3.1415926;
long radius = 5;
double *addr;
addr = &p; // ok
addr = &radius; // not ok
```

(`void *` is special)

---
### Pointer arithmetic

```C
long x = 1;
long *ptr = &x;
ptr += 1;
```

---
class: middle,center

`a[i]` is just another notation for `*(a + i)`

---

### Lab 5
.small[
```C
void foo(long n) {
  long x[3];
  x[n] = 1;
}

int main()
{
  long n = cs1010_read_long();
  foo(n);
  cs1010_println_long(n);
}
```
]

---
### Pointers are variables too

```C
long x;
long *ptr = &x;
long **ptrptr = &ptr;
```

---
### The `NULL` Pointer

A special pointer value that says a pointer points to "nothing".

---
class: middle,center

## Call by Reference

(non-array variables)

---
### Swap

.smaller[
```C
void swap(long *a, long *b) {
  long temp = *a;
  *a = *b;
  *b = temp;
}

int main() {
  long a = 10;
  long b = -4;
  swap(&a, &b);
}
```
]
---
class: middle,center

## Heap

---
- Heap (aka data segment) is another region of memory that a program can utilize 

- Explicitly "borrows" memory space for use

- Must "return" the memory space after use

---
### Why heap?

- Lifetime of content stored on heap can exceed the lifetime of the
  function that allocates it

- Size of heap is typically much larger than stack

---
How to borrow: `malloc` or `calloc`

.smaller[
```C
void *malloc(size_t size);
void *calloc(size_t count, size_t size);
```
]

How to return: `free`

.smaller[
```C
void free(void *);
```
]

---
### During execution, your code must access only

1. Memory on the allocated stack frames
2. Memory on the heap that the code borrows but hasn't returned

---
### Type `size_t`

- A _unsigned_ integer type used for array index, amount of memory, size of types, etc.  

---
.smaller[
```C
long* cs1010_read_long_array(size_t how_many)
{
  long *buffer = calloc(how_many, sizeof(long));
  if (buffer == NULL) {
    return NULL;
  }

  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; how_many; i += 1) {
    buffer[i] = cs1010_read_long();
  }

  return buffer;
}
```
]

---
.smaller[
```C
size_t len = cs1010_read_size_t();

long *list = cs1010_read_long_array(len);

long max = find_max(list, len);

free(list);
```
]

---
### Common Bug 1

.smaller[
```C
size_t len = cs1010_read_size_t();
long *list = cs1010_read_long_array(len);
long max = find_max(list, len);
free(list);

list[0] = 0; // use after free
```
]

---
### Common Bug 2

.smaller[
```C
size_t len = cs1010_read_size_t();
long *list = malloc(sizeof(long) * len);
list = cs1010_read_long_array(len); // memory leak!
long max = find_max(list, len);
free(list);

```

       | Size Known in Advanced | Size Determined During Run-time 
-------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------
Stack  | Fixed-size Array      | VLA (stay away)      
Heap   | stay away             | `malloc` / `calloc`

## Characters and Strings

---
class: middle,center

### `char` literals

`'A'`, `'a'`, `'4'`, `'0'`, `'*'`, `'\n'`, `'\\'`

.tiny[
A literal is a constant value in C program that cannot be changed (as opposed to a variable).
]

---
class: middle,center

```C
'A' + 1 == 'B'
```

---
### String

- An array of `char`
- Terminated with the null character `'\0'`

.small[
```C
char str[5] = { 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', '\0' };
```
is the same as
```C
char str[5] = "abcd";
```
]

---
### String Literals

Stored in read-only "text segment" in memory

.smaller[
```C
char *str1 = "Hello";    // str1 points to read-only array
char str2[6] = "Hello";  // str2 points to array on stack

str1[0] = 'h'; // run-time error
str2[0] = 'h'; // ok
```
]

---
### Summary of Important Rules

- Do not access memory space you are not allowed to.

- Always return memory space that you borrow.

---
### Homework

- Problem Set 15-17
