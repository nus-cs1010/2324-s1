## Open Book Exam

### Bring any materials you want

### Nothing to memorize

---
class:middle

## Not "bell-curved"

- Your grade is based solely on your marks
- Not relative to others in the class.

---
class: middle

## Plagiarism and Cheating

- No mercy policy in dealing with cases
- Not worth it to cheat/copy

---
class: middle

## Things To Do

- Read about other policies
- Get your accounts ready

---
class: center,middle

# Words of Advice

---
class: center,middle

## Work hard
## Work very very hard

---
class: center,middle

## Expected workload is 10 hours/week

But your mileage may vary

---
class: center,middle

## Learning in NUS SoC is different from your experience

---
class: center,middle

### Less rote learning
### More open-ended problems
### A lot more self-learning

---
class: center,middle

### You cannot just "study" programming or problem solving

### You have to invest lots of time actually doing it

---
class: center,middle

## Do not optimize for CAP and grades

---
class: center,middle

## Optimize for skills, knowledge, and experience

---
class: center,middle

## Invest time to master the tools

(e.g., `bash`, `vim`, `git`, etc)

---
class: center,middle

## Think long term gain, not just to get things done now

---
class: center,middle

## Don't be shy interacting with your instructors and tutors

---
class: center,middle

## This is a new start.  

### Put down your baggage about where you are from and what you have done to get here.

# Lecture 1

### 10 August 2020

Unit 1: **What is a Program?**<br>
Unit 2: **Computational Problems and Algorithms**<br>

---
class: middle,center

## What is a program?
---
class: middle,center

### A sequence of step-by-step instructions given to computers to process data in order to perform a certain task.
---
class: middle,center

### How CPU Executes a Program

.fit[![simplified](../docs/figures/simplfied-cpu-mem/simplfied-cpu-mem.001.png)]

.tiny[(A highly simplfied view)]

---
## Machine Code

- Instructions that can be interpreted by a CPU

- Different CPU architecture may use different instruction sets

`1001010001011110100010101010101000101`

---
## Assembly Language

- Use mnemonic to represent the instructions such as `incr`, `decr`, `store`, etc. in a more human-readable way.

- Still difficult to write: operation that is conceptually simple still requires multiple instructions to be issued.

---
## Higher-Level Language

- Allow programmers to express an operation closer to their intention

- E.g., $x = x + y$ if $y < 0$


---
## Higher-Level Languages

- FORTRAN (first popular programming language from 1950s)

- C (1972, still influential today)

- Many many others

---
## Compilation

A compiler _compiles_ a program written in high-level language to machine code.

### Learning to write a program that does what you want is the easy part.

### _Knowing what you want your program to do is the real challenge_!

---
class: middle,center

## What is a computational problem?

---
class: middle

## Computational problems are

- problems that can be solved _step-by-step_ by a computer

- have _well-defined_ inputs, outputs, and constraints

---
class: middle,center

# Is 1933091 prime?

---
class: middle,center

# Is there a route from a Point A to Point B?

---
class: middle,center

# Find a route from Point A to Point B.

(search problem)

---
class: middle,center

## How many different routes are there from Point A to Point B?

(counting problem)
---
class: middle,center

# Find the shortest route from Point A to Point B.

(optimization problem)
---
class: middle,center

# What is the meaning of life?

---

# Do I look good in this outfit?

## How to Solve It?

- Scan the integers one-by-one

- Keep track of the "max so far"

- When we are done scanning, the "max so far" will be the answer.

---
class: middle

## Problem Formulation

- Input: $L$ = $\langle l\_0,...,l\_{k-1\} \rangle$

- Output: $m$

- Constraint $m \in L$ and $m \ge l_i$ for all $i$.

---
class: middle

## Scan One-By-One

- $l_i$ : The number being scanned

- $i = 0, 1, \ldots k-1$

---
class: middle

## "Maximum So Far"

- $m$ : max so far

- $m = l_0$ initially

---
class: middle

## Keeping track 

- Compare $m$ with $l\_i$

- if $m < l\_i$, then update $m$ with the value of $l\_i$.

---
class: middle

## Done scanning?

- When we have scanned $l\_{k-1}$

---
class: middle

## The steps to solve a computational problem form the _algorithm_

---
class: middle

## Flowchart

$k$ | $i$ | $l\_i$ | $m$ 
:---|:----|--------|-----
    |     |        |  
    |     |        |  
    |     |        |  
    |     |        |    
]

---
## Variables

- $i$, $m$, $k$ are _variables_
- They have corresponding location in the memory and hold a _value_
- You can _read_ a value from a variable
- You can _write_ a value to a variable

---
## Assignment

- We can assign the value of a variable to a constant (e.g., set $i$ to 1)
- or to the value of another variable (e.g., set $m$ to $l_i$).

---
## Comparison

- We can compare the values of two variables
- E.g., $i$ equals $k$?  $l\_i > m$? 

---
## Arithmetic Operations

- We can perform arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, etc)
- E.g., we set $i$ to $i + 1$

---
class: middle

### Does this algorithm always correctly find the maximum value? 

.fit[![flowchart](../docs/figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart.001.png)]

---
class: middle

## Correctness 

- If an algorithm produces the correct output for one instance of input, it is not necessary correct

- To be correct, it has to produce the correct output _for all possible_ inputs!

---
class: middle

## How to check for correctness?

- Carefully choose a set of test cases to try
- Argue formally about the properties of the algorithms
---
class: middle

## Homework

- Post-Lecture Diagnostic Quiz (1%)
  - Due Thursday 10 AM of Week 3
  - You can have three attempts
- Problem Set 1.1 to 1.3 
  - Not graded.  To be discussed Week 3.
